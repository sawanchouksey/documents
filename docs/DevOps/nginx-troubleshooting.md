### Troubleshooting become easy with some useful Linux commands and knowledge based information

1. **502 Bad Gateway**
   
   This status code indicates that the Nginx server received an invalid response from the upstream server (e.g., the web server or application server) while acting as a proxy or gateway. In this case, the Nginx server is unable to serve the request because it cannot communicate with the backend server.
   
   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
   
   1. Check if the backend server (e.g., Apache, Node.js, or other web servers) is running and accessible. Ensure that the backend server is not down or experiencing issues.
      
      ```
      - Check the connectivity and accessiblity
      telnet backend-server-ip/dns-name port
      curl -k -vvv telnet://poc.marketplace.test.com:443
      
      - Check the backend Server is running or not
      systemctl status apache
      systemctl status httpd
      kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace_name> 
      ```
   
   2. Verify the Nginx configuration file (nginx.conf) to ensure that the upstream server settings (e.g., proxy_pass directive) are correct and pointing to the right backend server address and port.
      
      ```
      vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf
      vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      ```
   
   3. Check if there are any firewall rules or network restrictions that might be blocking the communication between Nginx and the backend server.
      
      ```
      sudo iptables -L -nv
      ping <backend_server_ip>
      nc -zv <backend_server_ip> <port_number>
      ```
   
   4. Increase the Nginx proxy timeout values (e.g., `proxy_read_timeout`, `proxy_send_timeout` etc. ) if the backend server is taking longer than expected to respond.
      
      ```
      cat/vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf
      cat/vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - Inside the `server` block, you can adjust the following timeout values:
      server {
      proxy_read_timeout 60s;
      proxy_send_timeout 60s;
      proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
      }
      ```
   
   5. Check the server's logs for any errors or issues that might be causing it to return invalid responses.
      
      ```
      - View the last 100 lines of the backend server's error log
      tail -n 100 /var/log/nginx/error.log
      
      - View the live status of the backend server's error log 
      tail -f /var/log/nginx/*.log | grep 'error]'
      ```
   
   6. Restart both Nginx and the backend server to see if the issue persists.
      
      ```
      sudo nginx -s reload
      sudo systemctl restart nginx  # On systems using systemd
      sudo service nginx restart    # On systems using SysV init
      ```

2. **503 Service Unavailable**
   
   This status code means that the Nginx server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or maintenance. It indicates that the server is unavailable at the moment, but it may become available again in the future.
   
   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
   
   1. Check if the Nginx server is experiencing high load or traffic spikes that might be causing it to become overloaded.
      
      ```
      - Monitor CPU and memory usage to identify potential bottlenecks.
      top or htop
      
      - List all listening network ports, including the ones used by Nginx. 
      netstat -ntlp 
      netstat -ant | grep -E '443' | grep 10.9.70.16
      ```
   
   2. Verify if there are any ongoing maintenance activities or configuration changes that might be causing the server to be unavailable temporarily.
   
   3. Check the Nginx error logs (error.log) for any relevant error messages or insights into the issue.
      
      ```
      - View the last 100 lines of the backend server's error log
      tail -n 100 /var/log/nginx/error.log
      
      - View the live status of the backend server's error log 
      tail -f /var/log/nginx/*.log | grep 'error]'
      ```
   
   4. Increase the worker processes (worker_processes directive) or configure load balancing if the server is consistently overloaded.
      
      ```
      cat/vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      worker_processes 4;  # For a system with 4 CPU cores
      ```
   
   5. If the issue is temporary, wait for the maintenance or overload situation to resolve before retrying.
   
   6. Restart Nginx to see if the issue persists.
      
      ```
      sudo nginx -s reload
      sudo systemctl restart nginx  # On systems using systemd
      sudo service nginx restart    # On systems using SysV init
      ```

3. **504 Gateway Timeout**
   
   This status code is returned when the Nginx server, acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server within the configured timeout period.
   
   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
   
   1. Increase the Nginx proxy timeout values (e.g., proxy_read_timeout, proxy_send_timeout) to allow more time for the backend server to respond.
      
      ```
      cat/vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf
      cat/vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - Inside the `server` block, you can adjust the following timeout values:
      server {
      proxy_read_timeout 60s;
      proxy_send_timeout 60s;
      proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
      }
      ```
   
   2. Check if the backend server is experiencing high load or performance issues that might be causing it to respond slowly.
      
      ```
      top or htop
      vmstat
      kubectl top <pod_name> -n <namespace_name>
      ```
   
   3. Optimize the backend server's performance by adding more resources (CPU, RAM), caching, or other performance tuning techniques.
   
   4. Verify if there are any network latency issues or bandwidth constraints between Nginx and the backend server.
      
      ```
      telnet backend-server-ip/dns-name port
      curl telnet://poc.marketplace.test.com:443
      ```
   
   5. Check the backend server's logs for any errors or issues that might be causing slow responses.
      
      ```
      - Check the backend Server is running or not
      systemctl status apache
      systemctl status httpd
      kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace_name>
      ```
   
   6. Restart both Nginx and the backend server to see if the issue persists.
      
      ```
      sudo nginx -s reload
      sudo systemctl restart nginx  # On systems using systemd
      sudo service nginx restart    # On systems using SysV init
      ```

4. **500 Internal Server Error**
   
   In some cases, when the Nginx server encounters an unexpected condition or an unrecoverable error, it may return a generic 500 Internal Server Error status code.
   
   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
   
   1. Check the Nginx error logs (error.log) for any specific error messages or details about the issue.
      
      ```
      - View the last 100 lines of the backend server's error log
      tail -n 100 /var/log/nginx/error.log
      
      - View the live status of the backend server's error log 
      tail -f /var/log/nginx/*.log | grep 'error]'
      ```
   
   2. Verify the Nginx configuration file (nginx.conf) for any syntax errors or misconfigured directives.
      
      ```
      vi /etc/nginx/*.conf
      vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf
      - To check the configuration is correct or not in /etc/nginx/*.conf files
      nginx -t 
      ```
   
   3. Ensure that the file permissions and ownership of the Nginx configuration files and directories are correct.
      
      ```
      sudo chmod 644 /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      sudo chmod 755 /etc/nginx/conf.d
      sudo chmod 755 /var/log/nginx
      ps aux | grep nginx
      sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /etc/nginx
      sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/log/nginx
      sudo restorecon -Rv /etc/nginx
      sudo restorecon -Rv /var/log/nginx
      cd /etc/nginx
      ls -larth
      ```
   
   4. Check if there are any third-party modules or custom configurations that might be causing conflicts or issues.
   
   5. Increase the Nginx worker processes (worker_processes directive) if the server is experiencing high load.
      
      ```
      cat/vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      ps aux | grep nginx
      worker_processes 4;  # For a system with 4 CPU cores
      ```
   
   6. If the issue persists, try disabling any third-party modules or custom configurations one by one to identify the culprit.
   
   7. As a last resort, try reinstalling or upgrading Nginx to a newer version.
