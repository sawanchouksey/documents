### Introduction to Nomad

- Much simpler alternative for k8s
- It helps to deploy, manage, and scale container for your environment
- It will helps us to deploy container on-prem,at the edge, and any cloud plateform .
- It provide multi-region and multi-datacenter support
- Nomad can scale a thousands node in a single cluster
- It support non-containerized worksload as well such as VM,binaries and more
- Tight integration with hashicorp ecosystem
- Orchestrate any application like
  1. Containarized
  2. Non-Containarized
  3. Batch Application
  4. Java Apps

### Nomad Components

1. Node 
   A physical or VM in the cluster . A node is a machine running in the Nomad Agent.

2. Agent
   
   Long Running daemon running on every member of the Nomad cluster. Agent can run in either client or server mode. This is essentially the binary that downloaded from Hshicorp.
   
   ##### Server : A agent running on a server that holds the global state of the cluster and participate in scheduling decision.
   
   #### Clients : An agent that fingerprints the host to determine the capablities, resources, and available drivers. Responsible for running workloads, such as containers.

3. Jobs  
   
   Defination of how a workloads should be scheduled. The Job specification(spec) is composed of one or more task groups , and each task defines a series of resource configuration and constraints.
   A job is submitted to Nomad and represents a desired state . for example run 3 instances of my application using the Docker image and spread them across three nodes to ensure high availablity.

4. Job Specification(jobspec)
   
   An HCL configuration file on disk which describe how a workload should be scheduled.
   It contains multiple stanza that defines configuration such as jobs, groups, tasks, services and resources for the application.
   
   ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/job-specification-file.png?raw=true)

5. Driver
   
   Pluggable components that executes a task and provide resource isolation.
   It must be installed/available before task can be executed. For example if you submit a job to schedule Docker Container Docker must be available on the Nomad clinets to use.
   For Example docker, java, podman, and raw-exec.

6. Task
   
   A command service application or "set of work" to be executed by Nomad.
   Tasks are executed by their driver.
   Exampls Include:
   Runs these container
   Execute these commands
   Run this Java application from .jar file
   
   ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/task-example.png?raw=true)

7. Task Group
   
   A collection of individual task that should be co-located on the same node.
   Any task within the defined group will be placed on the same Nomad client.
   This is especially useful for applications that require low latency or have high throughput to another application on task group.
   
   ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/task-group-example.png?raw=true)

8. Evaluation
   
   A calculation performed by the Nomad server to determine what action(s) need to take place to execute a job.
   Nomad performs evaluation whenever jobs are submitted or client state changes to determine if what changes need to be made to ensure the desired state.

9. Allocation
   
   The mapping of task in a job to clients is doing using allocations.
   An allocations used to declare that a set of tasks in a job should be run on a particular node.
   Allocation can fail if there are not enough resource to executed the task, a node is down etc.

### Scheduling Workflow in Nomad

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/scheduling-workflow.png?raw=true)

### Nomad Architecture

#### Datacenter

In the context of Nomad, a datacenter typically refers to a physical or virtual location where you run your infrastructure, such as a set of servers or nodes. These nodes can be in the same physical location or distributed across multiple locations.

The primary function of Nomad in a datacenter is to schedule and manage jobs and tasks. Nomad allows for efficient utilization of resources by automatically scheduling tasks on available resources and dynamically scaling the cluster based on demand.

```
-----------------------
nomad.hcl
-----------------------
datacenter "dc1" {
  # Configuration specific to datacenter "dc1"
  name = "Datacenter 1"
  region = "US-East"
  data_dir = "/var/lib/nomad/dc1"
  acl = "management"
  server {
    enabled = true
    bootstrap_expect = 3
  }
}

datacenter "dc2" {
  # Configuration specific to datacenter "dc2"
  name = "Datacenter 2"
  region = "EU-West"
  data_dir = "/var/lib/nomad/dc2"
  acl = "default"
  server {
    enabled = true
    bootstrap_expect = 5
  }
}

server {
  enabled = true
  bootstrap_expect = 3
}

client {
  enabled = true
  servers = ["nomad-server-1:4647", "nomad-server-2:4647", "nomad-server-3:4647"]
}

# Define the default datacenter for nodes that don't specify one
data_dir = "/var/lib/nomad"
```

#### [ Datacenter [ server + Client(Docker) ] ]

### Region

Collection of multiple datacenter often grouped geographically

### Server

The primary component of the Nomad architecture is the server. The servers handle the scheduling and management of the jobs and tasks that are submitted to the Nomad cluster.

### Client

The Nomad client is responsible for running the actual tasks and jobs that are submitted to the Nomad cluster. The client communicates with the servers and agents to request new tasks and jobs and report the status of the tasks and jobs that are running.

### Single Region Architecture

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/single-region-arch.png?raw=true)

### Multi Region Architecture

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/multi-region-arch.png?raw=true)

### Comparing Nomad to Kubernetes

Nomad is primarily task-scheduling plateform and can't orchestrate load balancing , config management and routing etc.

Nomad can scale to millions of containers (check out the 1 million and 2 million
container challenge HashiCorp did)

8. Create the Nomad service file at /etc/system/system/nomad.service
   and copy the configuration to this file.
   
   ```
   $ sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/nomad.service
   ```

  

### Starting the Nomad Services

1. Open /etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl in a text editor (vi, nano, etc.)
   
   ```
   $ sudo vi /etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl
   ```

2. Create the file based on the requirenment for example:
   
   ```
   name = "nomad_server_a"
   
   # Directory to store agent state
   data_dir = "/var/lib/nomad"
   
   # Address the Nomad agent should bing to for networking
   # 0.0.0.0 is the default and results in using the default private network interface
   # Any configurations under the addresses parameter will take precedence over this value
   bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"
   
   advertise {
     # Defaults to the first private IP address.
     http = "10.x.x.x" # must be reachable by Nomad CLI clients
     rpc  = "10.x.x.x" # must be reachable by Nomad client nodes
     serf = "10.x.x.x" # must be reachable by Nomad server nodes
   }
   
   ports {
     http = 4646
     rpc  = 4647
     serf = 4648
   }
   
   # TLS configurations
   tls {
     http = true
     rpc  = true
   
     ca_file   = "/etc/certs/ca.crt"
     cert_file = "/etc/certs/nomad.crt"
     key_file  = "/etc/certs/nomad.key"
   }
   
   # Specify the datacenter the agent is a member of
   datacenter = "dc1"
   
   # Logging Configurations
   log_level = "INFO"
   log_file  = "/var/log/nomad.log"
   
   # Server & Raft configuration
   server {
     enabled          = true
     bootstrap_expect = 3
     encrypt          = "Do7GerAsNtzK527dxRZJwpJANdS2NTFbKJIxIod84u0=" 
     license_path     = "/etc/nomad.d/nomad.hclic"
     server_join {
       retry_join = ["10.4.23.44", "10.4.54.112", "10.4.56.33"]
     }
     default_scheduler_config { 
       scheduler_algorithm = "spread" # change from default of binpack
     } 
   }
   
   # Client Configuration - Disable for Server nodes
   client {
     enabled = false
   }
   
   # Enable and configure ACLs
   acl {
     enabled    = true
     token_ttl  = "30s"
     policy_ttl = "60s"
     role_ttl   = "60s"
   }
   
   # [optional] Specifies configuration for connecting to Consul
   consul { 
     address = "consul.example.com:8500"
     ssl = true
     verify_server_hostname = true
   }
   
   # [optional] Specifies configuration for connecting to Vault
   vault {
     enabled     = true
     address     = "https://vault.example.com:8200"
     create_from_role = "nomad-cluster"
   }
   ```

3. Save the file
   
   ```
   ESC:wq
   ```

4. Start the Nomad service
   
   ```
   $ sudo systemctl start nomad
   ```

5. Validate the Nomad service is running
   
   ```
   $ sudo systemctl status nomad
   ```

6. Check to see if Nomad server is responding
   
   ```
   $ nomad server members
   ```

7. Optionally, view the journal logs
   
   ```
   $ sudo journalctl -b -u nomad
   ```

### Starting the Nomad Service – Dev Mode

```
$ nomad agent –dev –bind 0.0.0.0
```

- When Nomad started as development mode It is known as "dev agent & dev mode"

- This quickly start a single agent on your local machine and acts as server and client for testing

- Dev Mode never used for Production...It only for testing

- To start Nomad as client or server we first need a configuration file

- It is written in HCL contains all the information needed for Nomad to run

- configuration file differes for Nomad server vs Nomad Client agent

- Driver/Pre-requisite must be installed on Nomad Clients Such as "Docker"

- Other configuration such as Nomad User, directories, permissions and pre-requsite must be done before starting nomad server
  
  - systemd config file
  
  - Local Nomad user to run the service
  
  - Directories for storing config and logs

- Nomad Agents COnfiguration files with primary parameters
  
  ```
  name                 - name of the Nomad Agent
  data_dir             - directory where Nomad will store agent state(Data)
  bind_addr            - what IP address the Nomad agent should bind to for networking
  advertise {}         - what IP(s) to use to advertise for network services
  ports {}             - specify ports used for the different services
  tls {}               - TLS configuration
  datacenter           - define what datacenter the local agent is a member of
  log_file             - where does store Nomad Logs
  server {}            - Nomad Server configuration(No need for clients)
  client {}            - Nomad Client configuration(No need for servers) 
  acl {}               - ACL configuration (enable, TTL)
  vault {}             - configuration for vault Integration
  consul {}            - cofiguration for Consul integration
  {}                   = It means stanza
  ```

- However, you can start Nomad agent manually if you want using the
  Nomad command:
  
  ```
  # Start Nomad by point to a config file
  $ nomad agent –config /etc/nomad.d/server.hcl
  # Start Nomad by pointing to a directory
  $ nomad agent –config /etc/nomad.d
  ```

### Nomad clients with a Nomad server for communication,

To register Nomad clients with a Nomad server for communication, you need to set up a Nomad cluster. Nomad is a cluster manager and scheduler that allows you to manage and deploy applications across a cluster of machines. The Nomad server is responsible for managing the cluster, and Nomad clients are the machines or nodes in the cluster that run your applications.

Here are the general steps to register Nomad clients with a Nomad server:

1. **Install Nomad**:
   
   - First, you need to install Nomad on all the machines that will serve as clients. You can download it from the official website or use a package manager suitable for your operating system.

2. **Configure Nomad Clients**:
   
   - Edit the Nomad client configuration file (`client.hcl`) on each client machine. The configuration file should specify the address of the Nomad server and other client-specific settings. For example:
     
     ```
     datacenter = "dc1"
     data_dir = "/var/lib/nomad"
     client {
       enabled = true
       servers = ["1.2.3.4:4647", "5.6.7.8:4647"]
     }
     ```
     
     ```
     
     ```

3. **Start the Nomad Client**:
   
   - Start the Nomad client on each machine using the `nomad agent -config client.hcl` command. This registers the client with the specified Nomad server.

4. **Nomad Server Configuration**:
   
   - On the Nomad server, you need to configure the server itself. Create a server configuration file (`server.hcl`) and specify the server settings. For example:
     
     ```
     datacenter = "dc1"
     data_dir = "/var/lib/nomad"
     server {
       enabled = true
       bootstrap_expect = 3
     }
     ```

5. **Start the Nomad Server**:
   
   - Start the Nomad server using the `nomad agent -config server.hcl` command. This will bootstrap the server and allow it to coordinate client registrations and job scheduling.

6. **Verify Registration**:
   
   - After starting both Nomad clients and the server, you can verify that the clients have successfully registered by checking the Nomad server logs or using the Nomad CLI. You can use commands like `nomad node status` to view the registered nodes.

### Nomad Cluster - Typcial Deployment Architecture

- In a production environment, you'll need high availability that single node doesn't provide you
- A typical deployment architecture includes 3-5 servers per Nomad cluster
- The servers use the Raft protocol to elect a cluster "Leader" to manage priorities, evaluations, and allocations. The leader replicates data to followers
- The server nodes must maintain a quorum to ensure the Nomad service is up and running
  - 3-node cluster provides a failure tolerance of 1 node
  - 5-node cluster provides a failure tolerance of 2 nodes

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/5-node-arc.png?raw=true)

### Raft Overview

- Raft is the consensus protocol used by Nomad

- Only server nodes participate in Raft and make up the peer set

- All client nodes forward requests to servers

- Servers elect a leader and will automatically elect a new leader if the current leader becomes unavailable

- A quorum must be maintained, otherwise, Nomad cannot process log entries or elect a leader – Nomad will be unavailable

### Networking

- Servers should be able to communicate over a high bandwidth, low latency network
- Recommended to have <10ms latency between cluster members
- Nomad servers can be spread across cloud regions or datacenters if they meet the latency requirements

### Joining Servers to a Cluster

[Connect Nodes into a Cluster | Nomad | HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials/manage-clusters/clustering)

- Servers need to know how to connect to each other to form a cluster

- This can be done manually or automated using parameters the configuration file

- For most environments, configuration to automatically discover and join server agents to form a cluster will be done using the configuration file

- Join Manually by running command in follower b,c where server_a.example.com:4648 is hostname or DNS server name of Node a

- ```
  nomad server join server_a.example.com:4648
  ```

- Provision and setup your server nodes

- Manually join nodes b & c to node a to create a cluster where a= leader b,c = followers

- Use the Automated Way retry_join parameter to instruct Nomad to connect to the
  server agents listed. Can use DNS names or IP addresses

- ```
  # Server & Raft configuration
  server {
    enabled          = true
    bootstrap_expect = 3
    encrypt          = "Do7GerAsNtzK527dxRZJwpJANdS2NTFbKJIxIod84u0=" 
    license_path     = "/etc/nomad.d/nomad.hclic"
    server_join {
      retry_join = ["10.4.23.44", "10.4.54.112", "10.4.56.33"]
    }
    default_scheduler_config { 
      scheduler_algorithm = "spread" # change from default of binpack
    } 
  }
  ```

- We can auto join cluster by cloud tags as well

- ```
  # Server & Raft configuration
  server {
    enabled          = true
    bootstrap_expect = 5
  
    server_join {
      retry_join = ["provider=aws tag_key=nomad_cluster_id tag_value=us-east-1"]
    }
  }
  ```

   

- display list of known server and their status

### Nomad Clients

- Nomad clients are members of the Nomad datacenter responsible for executing tasks and jobs

- In other words, Nomad clients are responsible for running the containers and applications scheduled by Nomad

- Clients register with Nomad servers and the agent runs on dedicated servers (usually VMs) to maximize the resources available to run tasks and jobs

- You can have multiple clients in a cluster and Nomad servers allocate jobs to clients with its scheduling algorithm 

- Nomad Agent will run on the client with a client configuration

- Since workloads run on Nomad clients, other prerequisites need to be met before tasks and job

- For example, if you are running containers, you might need Docker or containerd installed and running, If you want virtualized workloads, you
  can install Firecracker or QEMU

- Nomad task driver binaries must also be downloaded and installed on the client as well

- Nomad client configuration
  
  ```
  # Server & Raft configuration
  server {
    enabled = false
  }
  # Client Configuration
  client {
    enabled = true
  
    server_join {
      retry_join = ["provider=aws tag_key=nomad_cluster_id tag_value=us-east-1"]
    }
  }
  ```

- display list of known client and their status
  
  ```
  $ Nomad node status
  ```

### Removing Server Nodes from the Cluster

- You might need to remove server nodes from the cluster to perform operations such as:
  
  - Regularly scheduled maintenance
  - Upgrading to new version of Nomad

- It's important that you remove server nodes the proper way to ensure Nomad (raft) is aware of your intentions
  
  ```
  # Remove a node using the id
  $ nomad operator raft remove-peer –peer-id="nomad_server_a"
  # Remove a node using the IP address
  $ nomad operator raft remove-peer –peer-address="10.0.3.45:4646"
  ```

### Removing Clients from the Cluster

- You might need to remove clients nodes from the cluster to perform operations such as:
  
  - Regularly scheduled maintenance
  - Upgrading to new version of Nomad
  - Reducing cluster size because of reduced performance needs or cost savings

- To ensure workloads are not impacted, you should disable scheduling eligibility on node(s) you want to remove

- Next, drain the client to migrate all existing allocations to other clients

- Finally, stop the Nomad service and decommission the node
  
  ```
  # View the status of the nodes in a cluster
  $ nomad node status
  # View the status of node, events, resources, and allocations
  $ nomad status <node_id>
  # Disable a client's eligibility to accept new allocations
  $ nomad node eligibility –disable <node_prefix>
  # Drain the allocations from a client node
  $ nomad node drain –enable <node_prefix>
  ```

### Secure Nomad Environments

Similar to most other HashiCorp products, it's up to YOU to secure the Nomad environment

- By default, Nomad is not secure:
  
  - TLS encryption is not configured – data between servers & clients are sent in clear text
  - ACLs are disabled meaning anybody can configured the Nomad environment
  - Namespaces are not used by default so there is no isolation between teams
  - Sentinel policies must be developed and applied where needed (Enterprise feature)
  - Gossip is not encrypted
  - Resource quotes are not configured so operators are not restricted to the underlying compute
    resources (Enterprise feature)

- Minimal security tasks for a secure production environment:

- Secure Nomad with TLS certificates 
  from a trusted CA to avoid sending data in clear text and eliminate MITM attacks

- Enable ACLs. 
  Otherwise, ANYBODY can make configuration changes to the cluster and workloads

- Don't run the Nomad service as the root user – 
  create an unprivileged user with only the permissions needed to run the service

- Lock down any directories 
  used on Nomad servers and clients to avoid accidental or intentional modifications to the binary, configuration files, drivers, systemd service files, etc.

- Limit SSH/RPD access 
  to the Nomad servers and clients. Use immutable infrastructure if possible

### Namespaces

Allows many teams and projects to share a single multi-region Nomad deployment without conflict

- ACL policies provide enforcement of namespaces

- Job IDs are required to be unique with a namespace but not across namespaces

- Namespaces are automatically replicated across regions for easy, centralized administration at scale

### Enabling TLS Encryption

- ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/tls.png?raw=true)

- Prevent unauthorized access to Nomad

- Stop any observation or tampering with communications

- Prevent server/client misconfigurations (accidental or malicious)

- Prevent services from representing themselves as a Nomad agents

- Nomad requires that you use certs from the same CA throughout the datacenter

- You will have multiple types of TLS certs for Nomad, including:
  
  - Server agents
  - Client agents
  - CLI and UI

- Certs need to be generated from a trusted CA – likely you have one deployed in your environment already, such as Vault. If not, you can use tools like openssl or cfssl

- Nomad requires that servers use a certificate that uses server.<region>.nomad and clients use client.<region>.nomad

- This is somewhat different than traditional TLS certs where you usually create a cert for the DNS name

- This strategy also prevents a client from presenting itself as a server

- TLS configuration as shown in the Nomad agent configuration file
  CA cert should be the same across all agents , Use the server cert & key for servers, Use the client cert & key for servers
  
  ```
  # TLS configurations
  tls {
    http = false
    rpc  = false
  
    ca_file   = "/etc/certs/ca.crt"
    cert_file = "/etc/certs/nomad.crt"
    key_file  = "/etc/certs/nomad.key"
  }
  ```

### Gossip Encryption

- By default, Gossip is NOT encrypted

- Gossip (Serf) uses an encryption key across all servers in the datacenter

- Federation requires that the same key be used on all other datacenters as well

- The gossip encryption key is a pre-shared key, meaning you must create it and provide it in the agent configuration file

- You can use any method that can create 32 random bytes encoded in base64, however, I recommend using the built-in tool to avoid any issues

- Key is placed in the configuration file in the server configuration stanza
  
  ```
  # Server & Raft configuration
  server {
    enabled          = true
    bootstrap_expect = 3
    encrypt          = "Do7GerAsNtzK527dxRZJwpJANdS2NTFbKJIxIod84u0=" 
    license_path     = "/etc/nomad.d/nomad.hclic"
    server_join {
      retry_join = ["10.4.23.44", "10.4.54.112", "10.4.56.33"]
    }
    default_scheduler_config { 
      scheduler_algorithm = "spread" # change from default of binpack
    } 
  }
  ```

- Each server agent configuration file should include this SAME key

- Encryption key can be easily created by using the nomad operator gossip keyring
  generate command
  
  ```
  $ nomad operator gossip keyring generate
  Do7GerAsNtzK527dxRZJwpJANdS2NTFbKJIxIod84u0=
  ```

- Use the command nomad agent-info to validate gossip is encrypted
  
  ```
  $ nomad agent-info
  ..
  serf
  intent_queue = 0
  member_time = 1
  query_queue = 0
  event_time = 1
  event_queue = 0
  failed = 0
  left = 0
  members = 5
  query_time = 1
  encrypted = true
  ```

### Secure Nomad with ACLs

- ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/acl.png?raw=true)

- Token-based authentication

- Tokens are associated with a policy that permits/denies access to capabilities in Nomad

- Policies are centrally managed

- Policies and tokens are automatically replicated across regions for easy, centralized administration at scale
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/acl-components.png?raw=true)

- Nomad ACLs are NOT enabled by default and therefore the ACL must be bootstrapped before you can use them to secure Nomad

- All servers must include the acl stanza and parameters in the agent config, otherwise you'll get an error message stating that ACL support is disabled
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/acl-steps.png?raw=true)

- update server configuration file
  
  ```
  acl {
    enabled    = true
    token_ttl  = "30s"
    policy_ttl = "60s"
    role_ttl   = "60s"
  }
  ```

- To bootstrap the ACL system, use the nomad acl bootstrap command:
  
  ```
  $ nomad acl bootstrap
  Accessor ID = 400a8f88-8f73-ef48-0750-fd122e2abe8d
  Secret ID = 4a8be0a9-459c-6598-ac8b-d80f26a6e8f0
  Name = Bootstrap Token
  Type = management
  Global = true
  Create Time = 2023-01-03 14:19:04.509226313 +0000 UTC
  Expiry Time = <none>
  Create Index = 9877
  Modify Index = 9877
  Policies = n/a
  Roles = n/a
  ```

### ACL Tokens

- When the ACL system is bootstrapped, you get the bootstrap token

- The bootstrap token is a management token that provides access to everything

- It is NOT recommended that you use this token for day-to-day operations

- Command to generate ACL token
  
  ```
  $ nomad acl token create -name="nomad_is_awesome" -policy="krausen"
  Accessor ID = ebea4525-51a4-3b6d-6511-da8fecf63eb1
  Secret ID = 0f8b37f4-6f22-ef1d-c9aa-e1f04a86dd76
  Name = nomad_is_awesome
  Type = client
  Global = false
  Create Time = 2023-01-03 18:41:06.447109751 +0000 UTC
  Expiry Time = <none>
  Create Index = 10166
  Modify Index = 10166
  Policies = krausen
  Roles = n/a
  ```

### ACL Policies

- Control access to Nomad data and APIs (RBAC)

- Written in HCL (or JSON) and contains one or more rules

- Policies generally have the following dispositions:
  
  - read – allows read and list of Nomad resources
  - write – allows read and write of Nomad resources
  - deny – denies read or write – takes precedence over any other permission
  - list – list resources but not provide details

- Other rules also allow more fine-grained controls and capabilities

- Policy written in HCL

- Provides write to most resources in Nomad

- More aligned to a Nomad operator

- policy example policy.hcl
  
  ```
  namespace "default" {
    #provided read and four additional rights
    policy = "read"
    capabilities = ["submit-job", "read-logs", "alloc-exec", "scale-job"] 
  }
  
  node {
    policy = "write"
  }
  
  plugin {
    policy = "list"
  }
  ```

### Namespace Capablities

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/ns-capa.png?raw=true)

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/ns-capa-1.png?raw=true)

- Interaction via CLI requires an ACL token to perform almost all operations

- There are a few ways you can provide the token:

- -token flag on the CLI with the desired command to be executed

- Setting the NOMAD_TOKEN environment variable
  
  ```
  # Use the –token flag for authentication
  $ nomad job run webapp.nomad –token=4a8be0a9-459c-6598-ac8b-d80f26a6e8f0
  
  # Set the NOMAD_TOKEN environment variable to authenticate
  $ export NOMAD_TOKEN=4a8be0a9-459c-6598-ac8b-d80f26a6e8f0
  $ nomad job run webapp.nomad
  ```

### Authenticate to the Nomad UI without exposing the token to the browser's history

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/acl-token-ui.png?raw=true)

### Interacting with Nomad

#### Nomad UI

- You don't need to log into a Nomad server to interact with Nomad. You can easily interact with Nomad clusters deployed in your datacenter by using
  the Nomad CLI on your own laptop/desktop

- Nomad also has an autocomplete that you can install for tab completion
  
  ```
  nomad –autocomplete-install
  ```
1. Remotely Connect to Nomad
   
   ```
   - To interact with a remote Nomad host, set the environment variable NOMAD_ADDR
   export NOMAD_ADDR=https://nomad.example.com:4646
   PS> $env:NOMAD_ADDR = "https://nomad.example.com:4646"
   set NOMAD_ADDR=https://nomad.example.com:4646
   
   - Alternatively, you can use the –address flag when running commands
   nomad server members –address=https://nomad.example.com:4646
   ```

2. Environment Variables
   
   ```
   NOMAD_ADDR              - The address of the Nomad server you want to interact with…
   NOMAD_REGION            - The region of the Nomad server to forward commands to…
   NOMAD_NAMESPACE         - The target namespace for queries and actions that you want to use…
   NOMAD_TOKEN             - The ACL token you want to use to authenticate to Nomad…
   ```

3. Nomad SubCommands
   
   ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/subcommand.png?raw=true)
   
   - All commands in the Nomad CLI start with nomad
   
   - Nomad has an extensive CLI with lots of subcommands
   
   - acl - agent - agent-info - alloc - config - deployment - eval - fmt - job - license - monitor - namespace - node - operator - plugin - quota
   
   - recommendation - scaling - sentinel - server - service - status - system - ui - var - version - volume
   
   - Nomad CLI supports help commands
   
   - Use –h or --help
   
   - or just press enter to see a list of available commands
   
   - The CLI is <mostly> used for managing jobs and therefore defaults to working with jobs unless you specify a different command name
     
     ```
     "nomad run myapp.nomad" is equal to "nomad job run myapp.nomad"
     "nomad status" is equal to "nomad job status"
     ```

#### Nomad UI

- Provides a simple interface to interact with Nomad

- View Nomad infrastructure, jobs, evaluations, allocations, variables, and more.

- Access the UI by hitting the URL (assuming default port):
  
  ```
  https://nomad.example.com:4646
  ```

- You can also get to the URL by using the nomad ui command:
  
  ```
  nomad ui
  ```

- Print the Nomad UI URL without opening the browser
  
  ```
  $ nomad ui –show-url
  URL for web UI: https://nomad.example.com:4646
  ```
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/nomad-ui.png?raw=true)

- disable/enbale "Eligible" button icon at top below client name header client page

#### Nomad API

- Nomad offers a fully-featured API to configure and work with your Nomad infrastructure

- In fact, the CLI and UI invokes the proper API when using them The API address is determined by the http address and port in the
  agent configuration file

- By default, the API uses port 4646

- All API routes are prefixed with v1/

- Additional information may be passed as a query parameter
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/api.png?raw=true)

- If ACLs are enabled, a Nomad token must be provided when invoking an API

- Authentication is done using the "X-Nomad-Token" or "Authorization: Bearer" header
  
  ```
  $ curl \
  --header "X-Nomad-Token: 4a8be0a9-459c-6598-ac8b-d80f26a6e8f0" \
  --request POST
  --data @myapp.json
  https://nomad.example.com:4646/v1/jobs
  ```

- prettify the json ou og API
  
  ```
  curl --header "X-Nomad-Token: 4a8be0a9-459c-6598-ac8b-d80f26a6e8f0" --request https://nomad.example.com:4646/v1/agent/members?pretty
  ```

- properly formatted output in json by JQ
  
  ```
  curl --header "X-Nomad-Token: 4a8be0a9-459c-6598-ac8b-d80f26a6e8f0" --request https://nomad.example.com:4646/v1/agent/members | jq
  ```

## Launching and Managing Nomad

- Task
  The smallest unit of scheduling work. It could be a Docker container, a Java application, or batch processing.

- Group
  A series of tasks that should be colocated on the same Nomad client. Tightly-coupled tasks in the same group can share the same network/storage.

- Job
  The declarative that defines the deployment rules for applications.

- Application
  The instance of a task group that are running on client.

- Run a Job in Nomad
  
  - Each job is submitted to Nomad using a job specification (job spec)
  
  - The job file is written in HCL (or JSON) and is often saved with a .nomad extension
  
  - Job files only contain one job, but they can have multiple tasks & groups if needed
  
  - Tasks define the actual work that will be executed while the driver controls how the task is executed
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/job-spec-hier.png?raw=true)

- Nomad Job Specification
  
  - The default job type is "service" so if you are deploying a service job, you can leave this parameter out. There are three types of jobs - service, batch, and system.
    
    https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification/hcl2
    
    ```
    job "tetris" {
        # ...
        # Specify the datacenters this job can run in
        datacenters = ["dc1"]
    
        #type of service i.e service,batch etc.
        type = "service"
    
        constraint {
        attribute = "$[attr.kernel.name}"
        value = "linux"
        }
    
        update {
        #update job but one task at a time only`
        max_parallel = 1
        }
    
        # ...
    }
    
    job "tetris" {
        # ...
        datacenters = ["dc1"]
        group "games" {
            count = 1
    
            network "web"{
                port "web"{
                    to = 80
                }
            }
            task "tetris" {
                driver = "docker"
                config {
                    image = "bsord/tetris"
                    ports = ["web"]
                    auth_soft_fail = true
                }
                resources {
                    cpu = 500 # 500MHz
                    memory = 256 # 256MB
                    network {
                    mbits = 10
                    }
            }
    }
    ```
  
  - All these configurations are in a single .nomad file or nomad.hcl
  
  - If you define job type is service. the container will automatically restart if it stopped.
    
    ```
    job "node-app-job"{
        type = "service"
        datacenters = ["dc1"]
        group "games" {
            count = 1
    
            network "web"{
                port "web"{
                    to = 80
                }
            service {
                name = ""
                port = "web"
                provider = "nomad"
    }
            }
            task "tetris" {
                driver = "docker"
                config {
                    image = "bsord/tetris"
                    ports = ["web"]
                    auth_soft_fail = true
                }
                resources {
                    cpu = 500 # 500MHz
                    memory = 256 # 256MB
                    network {
                    mbits = 10
                    }
            }
    }
    ```
  
  - The file can be stored in a code repo and iterated on as needed
  
  - The file will be submitted to Nomad to create our resources when we're ready to launch our application

- Validate Job Specification
  
  - Nomad CLI supports multiple ways to validate and format your job specification file
  
  - to check a job spec for any syntax errors or validation problems
    
    nomad validate <file>
    
    ```
    $ nomad validate tetris.nomad
    Job validation successful
    ```

### complete Job File for Nomad

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/job.png?raw=true)

### Running our first Nomad Job

- Once your job specification has been written, we can now create jobs and submit to Nomad to launch our application

- You can use the CLI or API to submit new jobs

- Use the command "nomad job run <file>" to submit the job to Nomad
  
  ```
  $ nomad job run [options] <file>
  ```

### Nomad Job Plan

- Nomad Job Plan

- Before you submit a "real" job, you can use the "nomad job run plan <file>" to perform a dry-run to determine what would happen if the job is submitted

- This is helpful to determine how the scheduler will react to the submission of this new job

- Can determine whether the job will run successfully, or it might show you that you have insufficient resources to run it
  
  ```
  $ nomad job run plan [options] <file>
  ```
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/plan-pass.png?raw=true)
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/plan-fail.png?raw=true)

- Ok, let's submit our tetris job with just a count of "1" which we know will work fine
  
  ```
  $ nomad job run tetris.nomad
          OR
  $ nomad run tetris.nomad

## How Can We Improve Our Environment?

- Spread our application across nodes for high availability
- Monitor our application logs
- Upgrading the version of our application
- Improve the way we access our application
- Scale our application for dynamic workloads
- Use variables to limit hardcoding values
- Integrate Nomad with Vault and Consul

### Job Placement

- When deploying applications, understanding where they will run is essential to ensure the maximum uptime and high availability for consumers
- By default, Nomad will use the "binpack" algorithm for allocations on available client nodes
- Bin packing can save costs by maximizing the resources of Nomad clients
- However, bin packing can introduce risk to your application because it may not be deployed across multiple client nodes
- You can configure Nomad scheduling to use a "spread" algorithm for the entire cluster, or you can customize it per job within the job specification

### Customizable Scheduling

- Choose “binpack” or “spread”
- Customizable as one simple string in Nomad’s configuration
- Scheduling algorithm applies to all applications deployed on the cluster
- When using spread, the scheduler will attempt to place allocations equally among the available values of the given target
- Spread can be used at the job level and/or the group level
- Spread can distribute tasks across datacenters if you have federated datacenters
- ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/binpack.png?raw=true)

### server and raft configuration

```
server{
 enabled = true
 bootstrap_expect = 3
 encrypt = "djkhfjkslkjfsgfkldjgkdjk"
 license_path = "/etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl"
 server_join{
 retry_join = ["10.1.1.1", "10.1.1.2"]
 }
 default_scheduler_config {
 scheduler_algorithm = "spread"
 }
 }
```

### Job Scheduling

- Spread is now under the job stanza

- This applies to all groups and tasks in the job specification

- Multiple groups in the job specification
  
  ```
  job "tetris" {
      datacenter = ["dc1", "dc2"]
  
      spread {
          attribute = "${node.datacenter}"
          target "dc1" {
              percent = 70
          }
          target "dc2"{
              percent = 30
          }        
      }
      group "frontend"{
          #...
          task "webapp" {
              #....
          }
      }
      group "Backend"{
          #...
          task "Java" {
              #....
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Job Scheduling (Multiple Spread Configurations)

- Spread all groups included in the job specification across both the nyc and sfo datacenters

- Within each datacenter, spread allocations for the frontend group across Nomad clients that have user-defined metadata for prod1 and prod2

- Note: If there is a conflict, the group level spread will take priority
  
  ```
  job "docs" {
    # Spread allocations over all datacenter
    spread {
      attribute = "${node.datacenter}"
      target "nyc" {
          percent = 70
      }
      target "sfo" {
          percent = 30
      }
    }
  
    group "example" {
      # Spread allocations over each rack based on desired percentage
        spread {
          attribute = "${meta.rack}"
          target "r1" {
            percent = 60
          }
          target "r2" {
            percent = 40
          }
        }
    }
  }
  ```

### Job Constraints

- Define Meta data in client configuration in nomad.hcl file
  
  ```
  client {
      enabled = true
      meta {
          env  = "prod1"
          rack = "rack-12"
          hardware = "cisco"
          instructor = "karuasen"
      }
  }
  ```

- Constraints are requirements Nomad must evaluate about the client, such as the operating system, architecture, kernel version, and more before allocations are made….

- Constraint requirements are specified at the job, group, or task level
  
  ```
  Examples:
      - Client must be Linux
      job "tetris"{
          datacenters = ["dc1","dc2"]
          constraint{
              attribute = "${attr.kernel.name}
              value = "Linux"
          }        
      }
      - Client must be running x64 architecture
      - Client must be running on an underlying AWS instance that is m5.8xlarge
      - Client must have specific metadata
  
            |----->job--->constraint
  Placement |----->job--->group--->constraint
            |----->job--->group--->task--->constraint
  ```

### Job Constraints Example

### Job Scaling

    resources{
        network{
        port "http" = {}
       }
    }
    scaling{
        enabled = true
        min = 5
        max = 10
        policy{   
     }
    }

### Networking

- When deploying applications, networking is a critical component to ensure users can access the running applications

- Networking is defined at the group level using the network stanza

- Options for networking include:
  
  - bridge: group will have an isolated network namespace with an interface bridged with the host
  
  - host: (default) - each task will join the host network namespace – a shared network namespace is not created
  
  - cni/<network>: task group will have an isolated network namespace with the CNI network
  
  - none: each task will have an isolated network without any network interfaces

#### Host Mode

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/host-mode-demo.png?raw=true)

- Access via host IP address and dynamically allocated port

- Default port range is 20000 – 32000

- Relies on the task drivers to implement port mapping

#### Bridge Mode

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/bridgw-mode-demo.png?raw=true)

- Access via host IP address and dynamically allocated port

- Default port range is 20000 - 32000

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/bridgw-mode.png?raw=true)

### Working with Volumes

- For workloads that require storage for stateful workloads, Nomad can provide access to host volumes or CSI volumes

- Nomad is aware of host volumes during the scheduling process, allowing it to make scheduling decisions based on the availability of host volumes on a specific client

- However, Nomad is NOT aware of Docker volumes because they are managed outside of Nomad. Therefore, the scheduler cannot make decisions based on availability

- Of course, volumes are available to other resources beyond containers, such as exec and java apps

- A host volume is essentially a path on the client that is made available to jobs. The
  data is stored locally on the Nomad client

- A csi-volume is exposed to jobs using a CSI plugin to consume externally created
  storage volumes. Examples of these include AWS EBS volumes, GCP persistent disks, Ceph, vSphere, and more
  
  #### Host Volume
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/host-vol.png?raw=true)
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/host-volume.png?raw=true)
  
  #### CSI Volume
  
  - CSI volumes are dynamically mounted by CSI plugins.
  
  - These plugins actually run as a system job and can mount volumes created by cloud providers or storage platforms. No updates to the client agent configuration file needed*!
  
  - Again, Nomad is aware of CSI volumes, which allows Nomad to schedule your workloads based on the availability of volumes on a client
  
  - Since the CSI plugins are written by the storage vendors, any CSI plugin that supports Kubernetes should work with Nomad
  
  - CSI volumes are supported by a large number of storage platforms and cloud
    providers, including:
    
    ```
    • Alicloud Disk/NAS/OSS
    • AWS EBS
    • AWS EFS
    • AWS FSx
    • Azure Blob/Disk/File
    • CephFS
    • Cisco Hyperflex
    • Dell EMC PowerMax/PowerScale/Unity/etc
    • Google Cloud Filestore/Storage
    • IBM
    • NFS
    • Portworx (Pure)
    • SMB
    • Synology
    • vSphere
    ```
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/csi-vol-steps.png?raw=true)

### Enable Priviledged Docker Jobs

- CSI plugins run as a privileged Docker job since they use bidirectional mount propagation to mount disks to the host

- The default configuration does not allow privileged Docker jobs, so you must update your client configuration to permit them
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/doc-job.png?raw=true)

### Create the Plugin Job

- Each CSI plugin supports one or more types of jobs – Controller, Nodes, or Monolith

- Most CSI plugins require that you run both a controller and a nodes job

- Node plugins are usually run as system jobs
  
  - These jobs use the csi_plugin stanza in the job spec file
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/plugin-job.png?raw=true)

### Deploy the Plugin Jobs to Nomad

- Once you have the plugin job specifications ready, you can create the jobs in Nomad:
  
  ```
  $ nomad job run csi_plugin.hcl
  ==> 2023-01-26T17:20:29-05:00: Monitoring evaluation "b66aaf83"
  2023-01-26T17:20:29-05:00: Evaluation triggered by job "plugin-aws-ebs-nodes"
  2023-01-26T17:20:30-05:00: Allocation "f329afdd" created: node "7ff357a0", group "nodes"
  2023-01-26T17:20:30-05:00: Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
  ==> 2023-01-26T17:20:30-05:00: Evaluation "b66aaf83" finished with status "complete
  ```

### Register the Volume

- Each volume needs to be registered with Nomad to ensure the CSI plugins
  know about each volume
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/reg-vol.png?raw=true)

### Create the Job to Use the Volume

- And….finally. Create the job for the task(s) that will consume the new CSI volume
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/vol-job.png?raw=true)

### By default, the port range that Nomad will use for allocating dynamic ports on client hosts

- `20000 – 32000`

### Nomad is NOT aware of Docker volumes because they are managed outside of Nomad. Therefore, the scheduler cannot make decisions based on availability.

### Managing Nomad Environments

- Monitoring the Nomad Environment

- Monitoring Application Logs

- Rotating Gossip Encryption Key

- Upgrading Nomad to Newer Version

## Nomad Monitoring

- Nomad offers multiple, integrated options to monitor the cluster for system events, audit logging, and events

- Nomad server and client agents collect runtime metrics that are useful for
  monitoring the health and performance of Nomad clusters

- The cluster leader also collects specific metrics as well

- Nomad clients have separate metrics for the host they are running on as well as
  each allocation being run

- Telemetry data can be sent to upstream systems at a 1 second interval (default),
  allowing you to leverage the capabilities of a monitoring provider to set up alerts and dashboards

### Viewing System Logs

You can view journal logs on Linux operating systems to view important information about the Nomad service. This is great for troubleshooting issues if Nomad won't start or if you think you have misconfigurations in your Nomad agent configuration

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/logs.png?raw=true)

Use the log_level and log_file parameters in the Nomad agent configuration file to
output logs for Nomad.

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/logs-1.png?raw=true)

### Getting Metrics from the API

Nomad offers an API endpoint to return metrics for the current Nomad process

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/metrics.png?raw=true)

### Configuring Telemetry

Telemetry logs provide metrics about the health of our cluster along with key
performance metrics we can use to validate or forecast the resources of our cluster

To enable and use telemetry metrics, add the stanza to Nomad client and server
configuration files to send metrics to Prometheus/Graphana, Splunk, DataDog, etc.

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/telemetry.png?raw=true)

## Application Monitoring

Beyond Nomad cluster logs, you might need to gather or monitor application logs for
security, performance, or troubleshooting purposes.

Nomad offers multiple options for collecting logs directly from an application:

- All tasks will write logs to the Nomad client under the alloc/logs directory

- Use the nomad alloc logs CLI command to view logs of an allocation

- Stream logs via the API using the /v1/client/fs/logs/<alloc> endpoint

### Allocation Logs

All tasks in Nomad will automatically write logs when running on Nomad clients

- Currently, there is no way to disable logging for tasks

- Tasks will write logs to a file in the directory: /data/alloc/<task>/alloc/logs/
  <stdout/stderr>.index

- You can change the maximum number of files Nomad will retain and the maximum size of those files

```

### Stream Logs via API

Using the API, you can stream the contents of a file in an allocation directory, such as
the stdout or stderr logs
Uses the full allocation ID (not the short one) as part of the API endpoint path

```
$ curl \

### Rotate the Gossip Encryption Key

Many organizations have security policies that require encryption keys to be rotated at least once a year, sometimes for often

Nomad has built-in features that allow you to easily generate, install, use, and remove an encryption key from the keyring

- Steps for Rotating the Gossip Encryption Key
  
  - Generate a new key using keyring generate
  
  - Install the new key to all members in the cluster
  
  - Change the encryption key used for gossip
  
  - Remove the old key from the cluster
  
  #### Generate a New Gossip Encryption Key
  
  - Use the key generate command included in Nomad to create a new key
  
  - This is the same command we used when talking about securing Nomad earlier in the course and you could use it the same way
  
  - Note: You'll get a unique key each time you run this command
    
    ```
    $ nomad operator gossip keyring generate
    WHvDRJKnCA3UyCUQv0wclfZM5XABgXXnn4qYxQhQBJE=
    ```
  
  #### Install the New Gossip Encryption Key
  
  - Install the new gossip encryption key. This will broadcast the key to all members in the cluster – only need to run it on one node, and all the other nodes will receive it.
  
  - Use the nomad operator gossip keyring install <key> command
    
    ```
    $ nomad operator gossip keyring install WHvDRJKnCA3UyCUQv0wclfZM5XABgXXnn4qYxQhQBJE=
    Installing new gossip encryption key...
    ```
  
  - Validate key change in logs
    
    ```
    $ journalctl –u nomad
    Jan 30 19:31:01 nomad_svr_a nomad[3060]: 2023-01-30T19:31:01.482Z [INFO] nomad: serf:
    Received install-key query
    ```
  
  #### View the Gossip Encryption Keys
  
  - View both keys in Nomad
    
    ```
    $ nomad operator gossip keyring list
    Gathering installed encryption keys...
    Key
    Do7GerAsNtzK527dxRZJwpJANdS2NTFbKJIxIod84u0=   # Old Key
    WHvDRJKnCA3UyCUQv0wclfZM5XABgXXnn4qYxQhQBJE=   # New Key
    ```
  
  #### Change the Encryption Key
  
  - Once the key has been installed, you can instruct Nomad to use the key for gossip encryption
  
  - Use the nomad operator gossip keyring use <key> command
    
    ```
    $ nomad operator gossip keyring use WHvDRJKnCA3UyCUQv0wclfZM5XABgXXnn4qYxQhQBJE=
    Changing primary gossip encryption key..
    
    $ journalctl –u nomad
    Jan 30 19:46:44 nomad_svr_a nomad[3060]: 2023-01-30T19:46:44.730Z [INFO] nomad:
    serf: Received use-key query
    ```
  
  #### Remove the Old Gossip Encryption Key
  
  - Once the new key is installed, we can easily remove the old key, leaving us with only the new key on the keyring to be used for gossip encryption
    
    Use the nomad operator gossip keyring remove <key> command
    
    ```
    $ nomad operator gossip keyring remove Do7GerAsNtzK527dxRZJwpJANdS2NTFbKJIxIod84u0=
    Removing gossip encryption key...
    ```

## Upgrading Nomad to a Newer Version

- Nothing says "Day 2 Operations" more than upgrading the cluster 

- Nomad supports both in-place upgrades by replacing the binary or rolling
  updates by adding new hosts to the cluster and removing the old ones

- Nomad is backward compatible for at least one point release but doesn't test
  or support upgrades beyond that

- Nomad does NOT support downgrading either

### Critical Items for Upgrading

![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/item-upg.png?raw=true)

### Order of Operations (Rolling)

- HashiCorp recommends to upgrade servers first since many new client
  features will not work until servers are upgraded

- Any new features (server and client) are unlikely to work correctly until all
  nodes in the cluster have been upgraded
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/sawan22071995/notes/blob/main/docs/DevOps/upgrade.png?raw=true)

### Order of Operations (In-Place)
