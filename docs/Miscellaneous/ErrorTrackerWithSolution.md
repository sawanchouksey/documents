## Error

```
kubectl logs <karpenter controller pod> -n karpenter
```

Error conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-10-11T12:15:20Z"
      message: Failed to resolve security groups
      reason: NodeClassNotReady
      status: "False"
      type: Ready

##### Explaination:
We Are facing issue after implementing `Karpenter` in AWS eks. All pods are always in pending state and not scheduling. Because `karpenter` not able to increase or create new node in eks.

##### Solution:

1. Check `ec2NodeClass` for `karpenter` and check tags are assigned correctly or not.

```
k get ec2nodeclass default -o yaml
```

2. check `securityGroup` and `subnet` have tagged listed as mentioned in `ec2NodeClass`. check spelling etc.

3. So we found there is tag mismatch in `security group` So update the tags in `ec2NodeClass` configuration and re-apply yaml file for it.

```
securityGroupSelectorTerms:
    securityGroupSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        karpenter.sh/discovery: testeksName
    subnetSelectorTerms:
    - tags:
        karpenter.sh/discovery: testeksName
```

```
kuebctl apply -f ec2NodeClass.yaml
```

4. Now please rollout restart the `karpenter` deployment.

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy karpenter -n karpenter
```

5. Check the configuration again and monitor it with scaling application

```
kubectl logs <karpenter controller pod> -n karpenter
```

```
conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-10-14T06:08:10Z"

## Error

Error syncing load balancer: failed to ensure load balancer: Multiple untagged security groups found for instance
i-0580321e00235d0f9: ensure the k88 security group is tagged

##### Explaination:

We are facing these issue normally using same VPC, secuirty group for mutiple Eks. During creating Service type `LoadBalancer` specially i.e. `creating istio-gteway-loadbalancer-service`.

##### Solution:

We need to Check and add few tags in `node security group` and `subnets`  as well

Multiple eks in same VPC

- The "shared" value allows more than one cluster to use the subnet or security group.
- The "Owned" value allows more than one cluster to use the subnet or security group.

All `subnet` must have tag if `same` subnet used in both eks worker node

```
"Key": "kubernetes.io/cluster/<Cluster-Name> ","Value": "shared"
```

All `subnet` must have tag if `different` subnet used in both eks worker node

```
"Key": "kubernetes.io/cluster/<Cluster-Name> ","Value": "owned"
```

All `secuirty group` must have tag if same `secuirty group` used in both eks worker node

```
"Key": "kubernetes.io/cluster/<Cluster-Name> ","Value": "shared"
```

All `secuirty group` must have tag if different `secuirty group` used in both eks worker node

```
"Key": "kubernetes.io/cluster/<Cluster-Name> ","Value": "owned"
```

## Error

We are facing `slightly delay` in getting `response` from API request around `120 seconds` in `Intermittent connection` specially whenever try to connect after first attempt.

##### Explanation:

We are using `nginx load Balancer as proxy server in ec2 instance`, `Istio service mesh with ingress gateway` which use `Network Load Balancer` in aws and application running in `eks pod` with `Java 21` and `spring boot application` written in `Kotlin`.

###### Solution:

- In `Nginx server ec2 intance` Check telnet for dns name configured with NLB with 443 port and check IP address try 4-5 times and monitor responses.
  
  ```
  telnet test-poc.alb.example.com 443
  ```

- Copy the `IP address` for the telnet output which is working and connecting quickly without delay.

- make an entry in `/etc/hosts` file with with `IP address and DNS Name`
  
  ```
  vi /etc/hosts
  10.0.23.45 test-poc.alb.example.com
  ```

- It will solve problem and everytime request coming nginx will send traffic to specific Network Load Balancer IP only.

- `References:`
  
  ##### TCP connection delays
  
  When both cross-zone load balancing and client IP preservation are enabled, a client connecting to different IPs on the same load balancer may be routed to the same target. If the client uses the same source port for both of these connections, the target will receive what appears to be a duplicate connection, which can lead to connection errors and TCP delays in establishing new connections. You can prevent this type of connection error by disabling cross-zone load balancing. For more information, seeÂ [Cross-zone load balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/network-load-balancers.html#cross-zone-load-balancing).
  
  ##### Intermittent connection failure when client IP preservation is enabled
  
  When client IP preservation is enabled, you might encounter TCP/IP connection limitations related to observed socket reuse on the targets. These connection limitations can occur when a client, or a NAT device in front of the client, uses the same source IP address and source port when connecting to multiple load balancer nodes simultaneously. If the load balancer routes these connections to the same target, the connections appear to the target as if they come from the same source socket, which results in connection errors. If this happens, clients can retry (if the connection fails) or reconnect (if the connection is interrupted). You can reduce this type of connection error by increasing the number of source ephemeral ports or by increasing the number of targets for the load balancer. You can prevent this type of connection error by disabling client IP preservation or by disabling cross-zone load balancing.
  
  Additionally, when client IP preservation is enabled, connectivity might fail if the clients that are connecting to the Network Load Balancer are also connected to targets behind the load balancer. To resolve this, you can disable client IP preservation on the affected target groups. Alternatively, have your clients connect only to the Network Load Balancer, or only to the targets, but not both.

##### Explanation:

We are using `EKS for application deployment` and `Istio for Service Mesh` for internal communication. So Whenever we deploy application it is successfully deploying in one node where istio-ingress-gateway deployed but whenever application increase replica and deployed in another new node It is giving error in `crashloopbackoff` for all pods in another node and application not deploying after multiple restart.

##### Solution:

1. We need to implement `node intercommunication`.

2. We can allow all the `ports` which used in `istio implementation` in `node security group`.
   
   [Istio Implements Ports]([Istio / Application Requirements](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/requirements/))

3. Allow or Create inbound rule for `node security group`.
   
   ```

   to_port: all
   protocol: custom
   source: Self Node Security Group
   Description: Allow Intercommunication between nodes

##### Explanation:

We faced this while deploying application in eks version 1.25 with containerd only having installed istio service mesh in AWS with self Managed Node in EKS.

##### Solution:

The issue arises due to there is `DCS security agent` running on all `ec2 worker node` instances in EKS. due to the it will not able to unmount and the path because that agent process holding the path.

- ###### what is `DCS agent`?
  
  In AWS security, a DCS (Distributed Cloud Service) agent refers to the software component that runs on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances or other compute resources to enable Amazon GuardDuty, a threat detection service.
  
  The DCS agent collects and analyzes data from various sources on the instance, such as network traffic, system logs, and other runtime behavior data. It then sends this data securely to GuardDuty for further analysis and threat detection.
  
  Some key functions of the DCS agent include:
  
  1. Network Traffic Monitoring: The agent captures network traffic metadata, including source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and packet details.
  2. System Log Collection: It collects and analyzes system logs from the operating system, applications, and AWS services running on the instance.
  3. Runtime Behavior Analysis: The agent monitors the runtime behavior of the instance, such as process execution, file access, and other activities, to detect potential threats or anomalies.
  4. Data Streaming: The collected data is securely streamed to GuardDuty for analysis and threat detection using machine learning and other security analytics techniques.
  
  The DCS agent is designed to have a minimal performance impact on the instance and is regularly updated to support new features and security enhancements. It plays a crucial role in GuardDuty's ability to detect potential threats and security incidents across AWS accounts and resources.

##### To stop `DCS agent` running process in EC2 instances . please run below command

```
ps -ef | grep -i sdcs; 
systemctl stop sisipsdaemon; 
systemctl disable sisipsdaemon; 
systemctl stop sisidsdaemon; 
systemctl disable sisidsdaemon; 
systemctl stop sisanddaemon; 
systemctl disable sisamddaemon;

failed to get cpu utilization: unable to get metrics for resource cpu: unable to fetch metrics from resource metrics API: the server could not find the requested resource (get pods.metrics.k8s.io)

```
kubectl get hpa -n uat-app | grep app-test
app-test               Deployment/app-test              <unknown>/70%, <unknown>/70%   1         3         1          142d
```

##### Explanation:

The error is occurring when trying to get CPU utilization.
It's unable to fetch metrics from the resource metrics API.
The server couldn't find the requested resource, specifically "pods.metrics.k8s.io".
This error typically occurs when the Metrics Server is not properly installed or configured in your Kubernetes cluster. The Metrics Server is responsible for collecting resource metrics from kubelets and exposing them through the Metrics API for use by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and other components.

##### Solution:

- Check API resources: List all available API resources in your cluster:
  
  ```
  kubectl api-resources
  ```

- Check API versions: List all available API versions:
  
  ```
  kubectl api-versions | grep metrics.k8s.io
  ```

- `metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1` api missing in eks kubectl api-versions. EKS doesn't come with the Metrics Server pre-installed. You can install it using the following steps: a. Download the Metrics Server manifest:
  
  ```
  wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
  ```

- Edit the file to add the necessary flags for EKS: Open the components.yaml file and find the Metrics Server deployment. Add these flags to the container args:
  
  ```
  --kubelet-insecure-tls
  --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP
  ```

- Apply the manifest:
  
  ```
  kubectl apply -f components.yaml
  ```

- Verify the installation: After installation, check if the Metrics Server pod is running:
  
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
  ```

- Wait for the API to become available: It may take a few minutes for the API to become available. You can check its status with:
  
  ```
  kubectl get apiservice v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io
  ```

- Test the metrics API: Once available, try accessing the metrics:
  
  ```
  kubectl top nodes
  kubectl get hpa -n uat-app | grep app-test
  app-test               Deployment/app-test              3%/70%, 23%/70%   1         3         1          142d
  ```

## Error
Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host 10.2.3.4 port 12323: Connection refused.
Unable to start service nginx: Job for nginx.service failed. See "systemctl status nginx.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

##### Explaination:
We have ec2 instance linux with `Nginx Service` AWS security group in place and also accessing server from ssh port `12323`. In secuirty fix we recently change `Selinux from Disabled to Enforce`.
##### Solution:
Yes, changing SELinux to enforcing mode can impact SSH operations, especially if there are specific SELinux policies that are not aligned with your SSH configuration. SELinux enforces security policies that can restrict which ports and services can be used, and it may block connections on non-standard ports if those ports are not explicitly allowed by the policy.

By default, SELinux is configured to allow SSH on port 22. If youâre using a non-standard port like 12323, you need to update the SELinux policy to allow SSH traffic on that port.

- To check if the port is allowed:

```
sudo semanage port -l | grep ssh

```

- To add a new port to the SELinux policy

```
sudo semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 12323

```

- Check logs for troubleshooting

```
sudo grep "denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log
sudo semodule -i mynginxpolicy.pp
sudo grep nginx /var/log/audit/audit.log

```

Migrating SELinux from `disabled` to `enforcing` mode introduces a set of security controls that can significantly impact how services and applications interact with the system. Hereâs a detailed overview of the potential impacts and considerations:

1. **Enforcement of Security Policies**

- **Mandatory Access Controls**: SELinux enforces mandatory access controls (MAC) that restrict how processes interact with files, directories, and other processes. Unlike discretionary access control (DAC), which is based on user permissions, MAC policies are enforced at a system level regardless of user permissions.

- **Access Denials**: Any operation that doesnât conform to the SELinux policy will be denied. This can affect file access, network communication, and process interactions.

2. **Service and Application Behavior**

- **Application Failures**: Services and applications may fail to start or operate correctly if their actions are blocked by SELinux policies. For example, if a web server tries to write to a directory that isnât allowed by the policy, it will fail.

- **Increased Security**: The primary benefit is increased security. SELinux policies help to limit the impact of vulnerabilities by restricting what compromised processes can do. For instance, even if an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web server, SELinux can prevent it from accessing sensitive files or other parts of the system.

3. **Impact on System Operations**

- **File and Directory Access**: SELinux policies define which files and directories can be accessed by which processes. You may need to adjust file contexts to ensure that services have the correct permissions.

- **Port Access**: SELinux controls which network ports services can use. If youâre running services on non-standard ports, youâll need to update SELinux policies to allow traffic on these ports.

4. **Logging and Troubleshooting**

- **Audit Logs**: SELinux generates audit logs for denied operations. These logs can be found in `/var/log/audit/audit.log` and are crucial for diagnosing issues related to policy enforcement.

- **Policy Management**: You may need to create or modify SELinux policies to ensure that all applications and services function correctly. Tools like `audit2allow` can help generate custom policies based on logged denials.

5. **Configuration Adjustments**

- **File Contexts**: Ensure that files and directories have the correct SELinux contexts. Use `semanage fcontext` and `restorecon` to set and apply contexts.

- **Policy Customization**: Depending on your systemâs needs, you might need to customize SELinux policies. This involves using `semanage` to add or modify policies for ports, file contexts, and services.

6. **Testing and Validation**

- **Testing Services**: Before migrating to `enforcing` mode, test all critical services to ensure they work as expected. Temporarily switch to `permissive` mode to identify and resolve any issues.

- **Validation**: After switching to `enforcing`, continuously monitor system logs and service behavior to ensure that everything is functioning correctly and that no unintended access denials are occurring.

7. **Steps to Migrate from Disabled to Enforcing**

1. **Review Current System State**: Check which services and applications are running and their current access patterns.
   
2. **Switch to Permissive Mode**: Temporarily switch SELinux to `permissive` mode to identify and address policy denials without blocking actions.
   ```bash
   sudo setenforce 0
   ```
   
3. **Address Denials**: Review audit logs and adjust policies as needed. Use `audit2allow` to generate custom policies.
   
4. **Apply Policies**: Use `semanage` to add necessary rules for ports, file contexts, and other configurations.
   
5. **Switch to Enforcing Mode**: Once adjustments are made, switch SELinux to `enforcing` mode.
   ```bash
   sudo setenforce 1
   ```

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor logs and system behavior, and adjust policies as necessary.

To update SELinux from `disabled` to `enforcing`, you'll need to modify the `/etc/selinux/config` file and then reboot your system to apply the changes. Hereâs a step-by-step guide:

##### **Step-by-Step Process**

**Edit the SELinux Configuration File**

1. **Open the Configuration File**:

   Use a text editor to open the SELinux configuration file. You can use `nano`, `vim`, or any other text editor you prefer.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/selinux/config
   ```

2. **Update the SELINUX Setting**:

   Locate the line that starts with `SELINUX=`. It will likely be set to `disabled` if you're currently not using SELinux. Change it to `enforcing` to enable SELinux in enforcing mode.

   ```plaintext
   SELINUX=enforcing
   ```

   The file should look something like this after the change:

   ```plaintext
   SELINUX=enforcing
   SELINUXTYPE=default
   ```

   - `SELINUX=enforcing` enables SELinux in enforcing mode.
   - `SELINUXTYPE=default` sets the policy type. You can leave it as `default` unless you need a different policy.

3. **Save the File**:

   - In `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter` to save the changes.
   - In `vim`, press `Esc`, then type `:wq`, and press `Enter`.

**Reboot the System**

To apply the changes, reboot your system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

3. **Verify SELinux Status**

After rebooting, check the status of SELinux to confirm that it is now in enforcing mode:

```bash
sestatus
```

You should see something like this:

```plaintext
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy version:                 34
Policy from config file:        targeted
```

##### **Address Potential Issues**

When you switch to `enforcing` mode, SELinux may block certain actions if the policies are not correctly configured. Hereâs how to handle potential issues:

1. **Review SELinux Logs**:
   Check the audit logs for any denials or issues that arise after enabling SELinux.

   ```bash
   sudo grep "denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log
   ```

2. **Create and Apply Custom Policies**:
   Use `audit2allow` to generate policies based on logged denials and apply them.

   ```bash
   sudo grep "denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mycustompolicy
   sudo semodule -i mycustompolicy.pp
   ```

3. **Verify and Adjust File Contexts**:
   Ensure that the correct SELinux contexts are applied to files and directories. Use `restorecon` to apply default contexts.

   ```bash
   sudo restorecon -R /path/to/directory
   ```

4. **Monitor Services and Applications**:
   Check that all services and applications are functioning correctly and adjust policies as necessary.

##### **Summary**

1. **Edit `/etc/selinux/config`** to set `SELINUX=enforcing`.
2. **Reboot the System** to apply the change.
3. **Verify SELinux Status** with `sestatus`.
4. **Address Issues** by reviewing logs, creating custom policies, and ensuring correct file contexts.
5. **Testing**: Validate services and applications in `permissive` mode before enforcing.
6. **Policy Management**: Adjust and create policies as needed to accommodate your systemâs requirements.
7. **Monitoring**: Continuously check logs and system behavior after switching to `enforcing` mode.

By following these steps, you enable SELinux in enforcing mode and ensure that your systemâs security policies are applied correctly. Migrating SELinux from `disabled` to `enforcing` mode brings significant security enhancements by applying mandatory access controls. However, it requires careful management of policies and configurations to ensure that all services and applications continue to function correctly. The migration process involves:
